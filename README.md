# VideoAnalytics
VideoAnalytics is a python framework to analyze videos / movies. Its main features are :
  * Shot Boundaries Detection
  * Effects Detection (such as Fade in, Fade out)
  * Colorimetry Information Extraction
  * More to come

## Shot Boundaries Detection
To implement this feature, we use the ECR (Edge Change Ratio) algorithm. An example of how to use it, is in the example file. A html page is also available to manually detect the hard cut in the image, so as to compute accuracy.
